I'm excited to design a beautiful and functional web app for eyesight diagnostics! This type of application could help users assess their vision through various tests and provide valuable insights about their eye health.

For inspiration, I'm thinking of clean medical interfaces like WebMD's vision tools, but with a more modern and engaging design like Warby Parker's virtual try-on experience - professional yet approachable.

For the first version, I'll implement the following features:

A welcoming homepage with information about available vision tests
A vision test selection page with various test options
A simple color blindness test implementation
A visual acuity (sharpness) test implementation
Results page that displays and explains test outcomes
About page with information on eye health
For the design, I'll use:

Colors: A soothing color palette with purples and blues as primary colors, complemented by soft neutrals
Typography: Clean, accessible fonts with good contrast for readability
Animations: Subtle transitions between test components
Layout: Responsive design that works well on all devices
UI: Intuitive interface with clear instructions for each test
Let's bring this vision to life!

I've created a beautiful and functional eyesight diagnostics web app with a modern design and intuitive interface. The app features a welcoming homepage, a test selection page, and implementations for both color blindness and visual acuity tests, plus a camera feature for future eye-scanning capabilities.

What's next?
Refine & Customize: Tweak the design, animations, and layouts via prompts or visual edits.
Master Prompting: Use clear, detailed, and iterative prompts for better outcomes.
GitHub Sync: Transfer your project's code to GitHub for two-way sync of edits.
Debug with Ease: Activate our experimental "chat mode" to troubleshoot issues quickly.
Add project knowledge: Set key context or custom instructions you want to include in every edit in this project.
When you want to let your users store data (like diagnostic results), login, or connect to AI for analysis, or other integrations, check out Supabase (the world's most popular backend as a service).
